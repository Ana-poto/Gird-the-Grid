## Summary


### Issue

In the creation of the C4 diagram of the application (level 1 to 3) some arhitectural omissions were made:
- on level 1 the server (which is a part of the app) was represented as a third-party element
- on level 1 and 2, the third-party Email System was not mentioned
- on level 2 and 3 the Grid API component was considered a third-party element 


### Decision

To corectly represent the elements of the C4 diagram.


### Status

Decided. We are open to new alternatives as they arise.


## Details
